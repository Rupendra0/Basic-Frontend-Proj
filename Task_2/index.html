              Albert Einstein waas a German-born theoretical physicist who is
              widely held as one of the most influential scientists. Best known
              for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made
              important contributions to quantum mechanics. His mass energy
              equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity,
              has been called "the world's most famous equation". Einstein's
              work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
              science.In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers,
              sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year).Einstein
              recorded that he had "mastered integral and differential calculus"
              while still just fourteen. His love of algebra and geometry was so
              great that at twelve.

              He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
              theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law
              of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
              quantum theory. Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to
              Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a
              subject of the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg) the following year. In
              1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and
              physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss In 1901, he acquired
              Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life.He often
              related a formative event from his youth, when he was sick in bed
              and his father brought him a compass. This sparked his lifelong
              fascination with electromagnetism. He realized that "Something
              deeply hidden had to be behind things."
