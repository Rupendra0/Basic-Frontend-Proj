# Responsive Calculator

## This Project was part of my internship under Oasis Infotech

### **Project Overview:**
The Responsive Calculator is designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience, whether theyâ€™re using a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. The primary goal was to create a tool that is not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to navigate.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** The backbone of my project, HTML provides the structure and layout of the calculator, ensuring that all components are well-organized and accessible.
- **CSS:** Through CSS, I focused on making the interface responsive and attractive. I implemented media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring that users enjoy a consistent experience across devices.
- **JavaScriptâ€‹:** This is where the magic happens! JavaScript powers the core functionality of the calculator. I utilized various features of JavaScript, including:
 - **DOM Manipulation:** This allows the calculator to dynamically update the display as users input values or perform operations. 
 - **Event Handling:** I implemented event listeners to capture user interactions, ensuring that each button press triggers the appropriate calculation.
 - **Arithmetic Logic:** The calculator can handle basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while also allowing users to clear and reset the calculations as needed.

### **Key Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** The calculator automatically adjusts its layout based on the device being used, providing an optimal viewing experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear and concise button design enhances usability, making it easy for users to perform calculations without confusion.
- **Memory Functions:** Users can store and recall values, adding functionality for more complex calculations.

### **Learning Experience:**
Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of JavaScript and its application in real-world scenarios. Working through challenges related to user input validation and responsive design pushed me to think critically and creatively. Iâ€™m proud of the final result and look forward to applying these skills to future projects!
