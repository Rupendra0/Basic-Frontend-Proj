# Login Page Project

## Overview

This project was completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It involves the development of a simple and user-friendly login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective was to create an interactive and responsive interface that validates user input and provides a seamless login experience.

## Features

- **User Interface**: The login page features a clean design with a modern aesthetic, ensuring ease of use across devices.
- **Input Validation**: JavaScript is utilized to validate user input for both username and password fields. It checks for empty fields and provides instant feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be mobile-friendly, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.
- **Error Handling**: Users receive clear messages for invalid inputs, enhancing the user experience and guiding them to correct mistakes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the login page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout to improve the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for input validation and dynamic interactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Rupendra0/OIBSIP.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter your username and password in the respective fields.
2. Click the "Login" button.
3. If the input is valid, the user will be directed to the next page (implementation pending). If not, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the foundational skills I acquired during my internship, including web development principles and best practices in JavaScript. I look forward to building upon this project and implementing more advanced features in the future.
